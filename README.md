# Advent of Code 2022, C++ only

This is my next Advent of Code attempt. Usually, I would get past the first few days and then give up due to the task requiring a specific algorithm I don't know or my solution being way too slow. The days I gave up on for the previous AoCs were: Day 13 (the record) for 2020 and Day 3 for 2021 (which I then re-attempted in another language to fail on Day 6). This year, there is an additional challenge of doing the thing in C++ (which is a challenge in and of itself). I'm also attempting to kickstart a pet functional paradigm library for C++ with this project (it's going to be located in `src/util`). If all goes well, this library may be separated into its own project in the future.
